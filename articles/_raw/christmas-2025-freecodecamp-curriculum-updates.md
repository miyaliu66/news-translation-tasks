Merry Christmas campers! 🎄 freeCodeCamp just shipped a ton of FREE learning tools for you to dig into over the holidays:

<!-- more -->

🏗️ The new Certified Full Stack Developer curriculum is here!

🗨️ The new English for Developers CEFR Level B1

🤳 Major updates to our mobile apps

## The freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer Path

Here's the full contents of the new Certified Full Stack Developer path. It's a doozy:

🛠️ 64 Workshops – Interactive step-by-step coding courses on tools ranging from HTML to SQL to Python (42 are now live)

🏛️ 513 Lectures – Short videos covering computer science concepts, with multiple choice questions to check your comprehension (313 are now live)

⚗️ 83 Labs – Projects where you start with a blank editor and a test suite, and have to build your project so that all the tests pass (60 are now live)

📰 62 Review Pages – Comprehensive lists of topics from each module that you can review to help you prepare for quizzes and exams (46 are now live)

🔬 66 Quizzes – To affirm your grasp of full stack development concepts and tools (46 are now live)

🏔️ 1 Capstone Project – a large, unique project that you'll build for your portfolio, reviewed by teachers within the freeCodeCamp community (Coming in 2025)

🤺 1 Final Exam – a comprehensive proctored 90-question certification exam taken within freeCodeCamp's new open source exam environment (Coming in 2025)

I recommend starting at the beginning, even if you’ve already learned some of these topics before.

You can dive right in and start working your way through [the new Certified Full Stack Developer curriculum][1] now.

## The English for Developers Curriculum CEFR Level B1

Last Christmas, we released CEFR Level A2 English coursework.

And I’m thrilled to say that after a year of hard work, we’ve not only gotten all of that live – we’ve also now shipped a big chunk of Level B1.

The certification exams will come out in 2025 as well.
