freeCodeCamp.org is a 501(c)(3) [donor-supported public charity][1].

<!-- more -->

I built the first version of freeCodeCamp's website in 2014. And now more than half a million people use freeCodeCamp every day.

Our tiny nonprofit is able to help so many people thanks to clever use of technology and the help of thousands of volunteers.

In this brief article, I'll tell you how you can support our mission by donating. And I'll give you all the information you need to get involved.

### How transparent is freeCodeCamp.org?

Very. We have a Platinum transparency rating [from GuideStar.org][2].

You can [download our IRS Determination Letter here][3].

And you can [download our most recent 990 (annual tax report) here][4].

### How efficient is freeCodeCamp?

freeCodeCamp's budget is much smaller than most comparable nonprofits. Part of that is because I am admittedly bad at fundraising. We haven't brought in professional fundraisers. Instead, I just do everything myself.

Am I a fool for doing this? Maybe. But I can look you in the eye and tell you exactly where all the money is going, because I oversee everything myself.

I can also tell you that – on a budget of only a few hundred thousand dollars per year – [we have been able to help millions of people][5].

![Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/freeCodeCamp_historic_usage_-_Google_Sheets.png) _Both the freeCodeCamp.org website and our community YouTube channel have been steadily growing each year since 2015. In 2022, we provided more than 4 billion minutes worth of instruction. (That's 8,000 years of helping people learn to code.)_

### What's the most common way people support freeCodeCamp?

You can [set up a simple $5 / month donation to our nonprofit here][6]. We are a very donation-efficient nonprofit, and every $5 you donate will help us provide more than 250 hours of learning to people around the world.

More than 8,000 kind people support us this way every month.

Depending on where you are in the world, $5 per month may not seem like much money. But it does add up, and this monthly approach makes it easier for our nonprofit to budget its mission.

### How can I make a one-time donation?

If you'd prefer to make one-time donations, you can support freeCodeCamp's mission whenever you have cash to spare. You can use [this link to donate whatever amount feels right through PayPal][7].

If you'd prefer to use a credit card to make a one-time donation, here are some quick links you can use. Just click the "checkout" button and you can input your information securely into Stripe (only they will see your credit card information):

-   [Make a one-time donation of $100][10]

### Does freeCodeCamp accept donations in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?

Yes, and we would welcome your cryptocurrency donations. Please [email quincy@freecodecamp.org][11] and he can give you a wallet address for whichever currency you'd like to donate.

### Can I mail a physical check?

### How can I set up matching gifts from my employer, or payroll deductions?

This varies from employer to employer, and our nonprofit is already listed in many of the big donation-matching databases.

Some people are able to volunteer for freeCodeCamp and their employer matches by donating a fixed amount per hour they volunteer. Other employers will match any donations the donors make up to a certain amount.

If you need help with this, please email me directly: quincy@freecodecamp.org.

### How can I set up an Endowment Gift to freeCodeCamp.org?

This would be a huge help. Since this is a more manual process, I can help walk you through it personally. Please email me directly at quincy@freecodecamp.org.

### How can I set up a Legacy gift to freeCodeCamp.org?

We would be honored to put such a gift to good use helping people around the world learn to code. Depending on where you live, this may also be tax exempt.

You can add this language, or something like it, to your will:

> I give, devise, and bequeath \[the sum of **\_** USD (or other currency) OR **\_** percent of the rest and residue of my estate\] to freeCodeCamp.org (Free Code Camp, Inc. tax identification number 82-0779546), a charitable corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, currently located at 3905 Hedgcoxe Rd, PO Box 250352, Plano, Texas, 75025 United States, to be used for its general charitable purposes at its discretion.

And I'd like to thank the Wikimedia Foundation for providing this formal language for us to use.

Again, if you have any questions about this process, please email me at quincy@freecodecamp.org.

### How can I donate stock to freeCodeCamp.org?

We would welcome your stock donations. Please email me directly and I can help you with this, and share our nonprofit's brokerage account details: quincy@freecodecamp.org.

### Can I get a donation receipt so that I can deduct my donation from my taxes?

Absolutely. Just forward the receipt from your transaction to donors@freecodecamp.org, and tell us you'd like a receipt and any special instructions you may have, and we'll reply with a receipt for you.

### **I set up a monthly donation, but I need to update or pause the monthly recurrence. How can I do this?**

Just forward one of your monthly donation receipts to donors@freecodecamp.org and tell us what you'd like us to do. We'll take care of this for you and send you confirmation.

### Is there anything else I can learn about donating to freeCodeCamp.org?

I think that's everything. I am not a career nonprofit executive – I am a teacher who is still learning a lot of this as I go.

If there is some other way you'd like to support our nonprofit and its mission that isn't listed here, or if you have any questions at all, please email me at quincy@freecodecamp.org.

I am honored by the faith you have placed in freeCodeCamp.org to be a good steward of the global developer community. We will take seriously all donations, and any questions you may have about our nonprofit. Peace be with you.
